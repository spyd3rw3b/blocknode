## About the Video Course
Blockchain is a revolutionary technology. Bitcoin is an example of it but far from the only one, just as email is one particular use of the Internet. Ethereum is a decentralized Blockchain platform that runs smart contracts.

Our course will teach you to build an online gaming application using the Ethereum Blockchain. Each 30 minute section will introduce fundamental Blockchain programming concepts as they relate to creating an online game, followed by practical exercises that customers can implement as homework assignments. With this course, you will learn core Blockchain application development skills, creating smart contracts, interacting with the Ethereum network, building user interfaces, and deploying your application to the Internet.

This course supplies seven self-contained lessons taught in a practical, hands-on way. By the end of the course, you will be amazed how much you have learned about Blockchain application development on the Ethereum network in just one week.

## React, Redux, Truffle, and Material-UI Dapp

In addition to Webpack and React, this box adds: React-Router, Redux and Material-UI for easy skinning of a Dapp.

## Installation

1. Install node.js (version 10.15.0)

1. Install webpack globally
    ```
    npm install -g webpack
    npm install -g webpack-cli
    ```

1. Install npm dependencies
   ```
   npm install
   ```

1. Install truffle and Ganache, both available from [Truffle](https://truffleframework.com/).

1. Compile and migrate the contracts.
    ```javascript
    truffle compile
    truffle migrate
    ```

1. Run the webpack server for front-end hot reloading. For now, smart contract changes must be manually recompiled and migrated.
    ```javascript
    npm start
    ```

## Docker

1. Build the docker container.
    ```
    docker build -t etherslist .
    ```

1. Launch the docker container.
    ```
    docker run -p 3000:3000 etherslist:latest
    ```

1. Browse to http://localhost:3000

## FAQ

* __Why is there both a truffle.js file and a truffle-config.js file?__

    Truffle requires the truffle.js file be named truffle-config on Windows machines. Feel free to delete the file that doesn't correspond to your platform.
